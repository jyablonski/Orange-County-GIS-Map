# Orange-County-GIS-Map

Below are 2 visualizations I created following this - https://www.tylermw.com/a-step-by-step-guide-to-making-3d-maps-with-satellite-imagery-in-r/ - step by step guide.  The tutorial shows how to create a visualization of Zion National Park in Utah, but I chose to model my hometown in Orange County, California.  Working with GIS data is fascinating and something that I haven't been accustomed to manipulating before.
